Thoughts on backstory:

Rick and Brian are meeting at a coffee shop as an informal hangout meeting.
The two of them have been friends for a long time, dating back to high school.
They've been through a lot together, and have remained friends, but their
friendship has occasionally been strained.

Rick is gay, Brian is straight. Brian has been in and out of relationships in
the past few months, and is attempting to balance a desire for sensation and
release with a deeper sense that he's missing something. Also is concerned that
he is getting older (both are in late 20s) and he should be finding some
direction in his life. Brian has been working random jobs and rarely holding
anything down.

Rick has been more stable, but is struggling with his own anxieties and desires.
Rick has the opposite problem, where he feels like his life is too stable, and
he is interested in more adventure. Rick is in a relationship with another
character, Sam, who is himself frustrated with Rick's stability and has been
having flings with other guys. Rick knows this, but is pretending that it hasn't
been happening.

Rick is waiting at the coffee shop, Brian is late again, as usual.

player agent should be Brian, I think.......
Gives a choice as to whether to be apologetic or what.
